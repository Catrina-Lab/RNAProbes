Results for "example_large.ct" using 20 as probe length,
for 50 probes, and blast choice = y, and for a target region between 1 and 2869 nucleotides:  
	1. Total number of possible probes =  2850
	2. Number of probes that have a GC content between 30% and 56% =  1891
	3. Number of probes that meet GC and energetic criteria =  716
	4. Number of probes that have an ss-count fraction larger than 0.5 =  565
