Results for "C:\Users\aviro\Documents\Code\Misc\Summers\Summer 2025 - RNA\Code\RNASuite\src\rnaprobes\tests\test_files\example_small.ct" using 20 as probe length, 
for 35 probes, and blast choice = n, and for a target region between 1 and 85 nucleotides:  
	1. Total number of possible probes =  66
	2. Number of probes that have a GC content between 30% and 56% =  37
	3. Number of probes that meet GC and energetic criteria =  35
	4. Number of probes that have an ss-count fraction larger than 0.5 =  36
